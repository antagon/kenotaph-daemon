version 1.0.2
-------------

* BUGFIX: when capturing on multiple interfaces, device sections defined in
one interface were overwritten by device sections defined in the next.

version 1.0.1
-------------

* Log interface errors, in case we cannot read a packet from the queue. In
this case ERR event is send out, but nothing was written in syslog. This
version fixes that.

* In configuration, in the interface section, setting option 'enabled' to
false did not cause the section to be disabled.

* New option 'enabled' for device section. This way configuration generators
can enable or disable given device section without actually deleting it from
its output. By default this option is set to true.

* In configuration, do a proper cleanup of used resources if a configuration
fails.

* If a pid file was an empty file, undefined behaviour could occur.

* Trigger the event ERR only for device sections which were recently seen on a
network (event BEG was sent). Before this change, all device sections
configured on a faulty interface were 'leaked' to connected clients.

* Support BPF's 'broadcast' directive by detecting interface's netmask. If no
IP address is assigned, compilation will fail.

version 1.0.0
-------------

* Initial version release. Source is based on etherpoke v2.5.0, all parts
related to execution of event hooks were removed, sending of socket
notifications has been overhauled to achieve better performance.

* libconfig replaced by libconfuse. This made the parser's code much simpler
and config file syntax cleaner.

* Make '-t, --hostname' mandatory, as there is no other purpose but to send
notifications via TCP/IP.

* New configuration option 'promisc_mode' which allows to set/unset
promiscuous mode of a NIC card. This option was not present in the original
source code. By default, promiscuous mode is enabled.

* Send notifications to single client in burst mode.

* Do not define interface name as an option for each device section, instead,
use an adjacent section of which all device sections are part of. All
interface related options (monitor_mode, promisc_mode, link_type) are now part
of this section and have to be specified only once for each interface.
