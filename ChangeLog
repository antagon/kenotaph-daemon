version 1.0.0
-------------

* Initial version release. Source is based on etherpoke v2.5.0, all parts
related to execution of event hooks were removed, sending of socket
notifications has been overhauled to achieve better performance.

* libconfig replaced by libconfuse. This made the parser's code much simpler
and config file syntax cleaner.

* Make '-t, --hostname' mandatory, as there is no other purpose but to send
notifications via TCP/IP.

* New configuration option 'promisc_mode' which allows to set/unset
promiscuous mode of a NIC card. This option was not present in the original
source code. By default, promiscuous mode is enabled.

* Send notifications to single client in burst mode.

* Do not define interface name as an option for each device rule, instead, use
an adjacent section of which all device rules are part of. All interface
related options (monitor_mode, promisc_mode, link_type) are now part of this
section and have to be specified only once for each interface.
