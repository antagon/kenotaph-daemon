version 1.0.0
-------------

* Initial version release. Source is based on etherpoke v2.5.0, though many
parts related to execution of event hooks were removed, and other parts were
tuned-up for performance. Format of a configuration remains the same,
including the option names, though their number was substantially lowered.

* Make '-t, --hostname' mandatory, as there is no other purpose but to send
notifications via TCP/IP.

* New configuration option 'promisc_mode' which allows to set/unset
promiscuous mode of a NIC card. This option was not present in the original
source code. By default, promiscuous mode is enabled.

* Send notifications to a single client in burst mode.
