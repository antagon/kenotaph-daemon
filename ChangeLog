version 1.0.0
-------------

* Initial version release. Source is based on etherpoke v2.5.0, all parts
related to execution of event hooks were removed, sending of the socket
notifications has been overhauled to achieve better performance.

* libconfig replaced by libconfuse.

* Make '-t, --hostname' mandatory, as there is no other purpose but to send
notifications via TCP/IP.

* New configuration option 'promisc_mode' which allows to set/unset
promiscuous mode of a NIC card. This option was not present in the original
source code. By default, promiscuous mode is enabled.

* Send notifications to single client in burst mode.

* Do not define interface as an option for each device rule, instead, use an
adjacent group of which all device rules are part of.
