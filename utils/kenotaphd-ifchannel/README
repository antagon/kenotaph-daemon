kenotaph-ifchannel <config-file>

This utility may be helpful for scripts that try to change a channel for a
network interface. Instead of writting elaborate regular expression to parse a
configuration file, this utility prints out all interfaces found in a
configuration file, which are set in monitor mode, and the option 'channel' is
set to nonzero value.
